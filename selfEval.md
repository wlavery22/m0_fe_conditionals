# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel confident, the comparison operators were very straightforward. The only time they get hard is when you combine them with other concepts were learned in this segment, like "else if" statements.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
As above, by themselves they didn't seem that complicated. When you combine them with "else if" statements it can be challenging.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I felt like the if statements were the most challenging, especially the difference between the else if and else, but they were also the most rewarding because when combined with console.log we were able to actually write bits of code we could run.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent many hours on it, it was a lot more than my estimate. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to learn to work faster and budget more time for assignments.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Some of the exercises in the reading were very challenging for me, as were the codeChallenges in the check for understanding. I need to go back and work them again.
